## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

All games follow a client-server architecture with the following common features:
- TCP/IP based communication
- Multi-threading for handling multiple clients
- Real-time game state synchronization
- Robust error handling and connection management

## üéØ Project Presentation

The project includes:
- Technical presentation slides
- Live demonstration of all three games
- Architecture and design explanation
- Network protocol documentation
- Performance analysis and testing results

Key presentation points:
- Implementation challenges and solutions
- Concurrent user handling demonstration
- Network latency management
- Error handling scenarios
- Future improvement possibilities

## üîß Prerequisites

- GCC compiler
- POSIX-compliant operating system (Linux/Unix/Windows with WSL)
- Basic networking capabilities
- Required libraries:
  - Standard C libraries
  - Socket programming libraries
  - pthread library

## üöÄ Getting Started

Each game has its own directory with specific instructions. Please refer to the individual README files in each game's directory for detailed setup and running instructions.

### General Setup Steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Snehak2208/TEAM5_OSminiProject-.git]
cd OS_2nd_2025_Group_5_MultiplayerGamingSys
```

2. Navigate to the specific game directory:
```bash
cd "Game 1"  # For Number Guessing Game
cd "Game 2 chess"  # For Chess
cd "Game 3 treasure hunt"  # For Treasure Hunt
```

3. Follow the specific compilation and running instructions in each game's README.

## üìñ Documentation

Each game comes with its own detailed documentation in its respective directory:
- Game 1 (Number Guessing Game): `Game 1/README.md`
- Game 2 (Chess): `Game 2 chess/README.md`
- Game 3 (Treasure Hunt): `Game 3 treasure hunt/README.md`
